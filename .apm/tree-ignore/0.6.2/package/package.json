With Atom, you can make it globally, or for each project, *via* the `gitignore` file.  \nBut... if you don't want to hide file globally, or ignore them in your repo ?\n\nUse an `.atomignore` file in your projects !\n\nIt works like a regular `.gitignore` file, but only hide the files & folders in the Atom's tree view.\n\n## Usage\n\nSimply add an `.atomignore` file in your project.\n\nYou can also control the state of hiding by using `tree-ignore:toggle`, `tree-ignore:enable` & `tree-ignore:disable` commands.\n\n## Keybindings\n\nWith the success of Atom, it's really difficult to choose keybindings that will not enter in conflict with anyone else's packages, so I have removed the default keystrokes and let the keymap empty to let you set your own keybindings.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/leny/atom-tree-ignore/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/leny/atom-tree-ignore#readme","_id":"tree-ignore@0.6.2","_shasum":"6d488f6e024f15ec5aade490eec2cf0d13a96574","_resolved":"file:../d-11683-22067-nsg8io/package.tgz","_from":"../d-11683-22067-nsg8io/package.tgz"}
