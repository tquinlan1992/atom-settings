But `atom.config` is not usable for saving information from multiple instances in same time on closing *windows* by quitting Atom.\n\nInstead of using `atom.config`, this package use following files:\n\n- **opened directory** (`~/.atom/restore-windows/opened/`)\n\n Each instance save a file containing their *project path* on loading and remove it on `beforeunload`.\n\n- **may be restored directory** (`~/.atom/restore-windows/mayBeRestored/`)\n\n Every instance save a file containing their *project path* on `beforeunload`.\n\nThis package restore *windows* as following steps:\n\n1. If **opened directory** is not empty, another instance of Atom window is exists. Stop restoring.\n2. Collect *project path* and *timestamp* from **may be restored directory**.  If *timestamp* is **near past (default: 5sec)** from latest, *project* should be opened.\n3. Remove files from **may be restored directory** on enumeration.\n4. Call `atom.open()` passing *project paths* for openeing windows.\n5. Atom will restore all windows state on openeing it.\n\n## License\nMIT\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/norio-nomura/restore-windows/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/norio-nomura/restore-windows#readme","_id":"restore-windows@0.4.1","_shasum":"51288a7555827b79c86c897d843a3d5bce5f64df","_resolved":"file:../d-11617-38683-1cukd7r/package.tgz","_from":"../d-11617-38683-1cukd7r/package.tgz"}
