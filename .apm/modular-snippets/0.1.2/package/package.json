These _local_ snippets are loaded from the first item found in the root of your project base on the following order:\n\n* `[.]snippets.cson`\n* `[.]snippets/**/*.cson`\n* `snippets: {object}` in `package.json`\n* `snippets: {object}` in [`project.cson`]\n\nAPI\n---\nThis package also provides a [service] to load any snippets `{object}`, file or folder…\n~~~ js\n// package.json\n\"consumedServices\": {\n  \"modular-snippets\": {\n    \"versions\": {\n      \"^1.0.0\": \"consume\"\n    }\n  }\n},\n~~~\n~~~ coffee\n# index.coffee\n{Disposable} = require 'atom'\n\nsnippet = { # object }, file or folder.\n  '.source.coffee':\n    Snippet:\n      prefix: 'prefix'\n      body: 'snippet'\n}\nconsume: (@snippets) ->\n  new Disposable => stopUsingService @snippets\n\n@snippets.load snippet\n~~~\n\nInstall\n-------\n`apm install modular-snippets` or search “snippets” under packages within Atom.\n\nLicense\n-------\n[MIT] © [Daniel Bayley]\n\nThanks to [@thibmaek] for the base repository.\n\n[MIT]:\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLICENSE.md\n[Daniel Bayley]:\t\thttps://github.com/danielbayley\n[atom]:\t\t\t\t\t\t\thttps://atom.io\n[apm]:\t\t\t\t\t\t\thttps://img.shields.io/apm/v/modular-snippets.svg?style=flat-square\n\n[`ATOM_HOME`]:\t\t\thttp://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/basic-customization/#custom-home-location-with-an-environment-variable\n[service]:\t\t\t\t\thttp://flight-manual.atom.io/behind-atom/sections/interacting-with-other-packages-via-services\n[sync-settings]:\t\thttps://atom.io/packages/sync-settings\n[`project.cson`]:\t\thttps://github.com/danielbrodin/atom-project-manager/#local-settings-file\n[gist]:\t\t\t\t\t\t\thttps://github.com/gist\n[@thibmaek]:\t\t\t\thttps://atom.io/users/thibmaek\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"modular-snippets@0.1.2","_shasum":"7370b75273392dd14d390b5aea5cb9aade30f1b8","_resolved":"file:../d-11684-4117-20ny1c/package.tgz","_from":"../d-11684-4117-20ny1c/package.tgz"}
