The other pane will stop or jump ahead as needed to keep the content aligned.\n- You may switch between the files to change which is the \"master\" and which is the \"slave\".\n- To stop syncing, click on `SrclSync` in the status bar or close one of the tabs.\n\n#License\n\nCopyright Mark Hahn by MIT license.","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mark-hahn/scroll-sync/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/mark-hahn/scroll-sync#readme","_id":"scroll-sync@0.1.4","_shasum":"0aa504b298139c168cd2d12e8557af28d104a5a8","_resolved":"file:../d-116211-703-1b9vpzz/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116211-703-1b9vpzz/package.tgz"}
