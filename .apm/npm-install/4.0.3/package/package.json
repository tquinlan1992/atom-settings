Select the `require` or `import` statements of the\n   packages you want to install.\n2. Open the Command Palette, and type `npm install` to\n   bring up the available commands.\n3. Your packages will be installed. Enjoy!\n\n## Configuration Options\n\nAccessible from `Settings > Packages > npm-install`:\n\n* **Install Cache:** force your installations to always or never use the local cache.\n* **Custom npm PATH lookup:** useful if you keep your npm\n  in an unconventional location. Point this to the directory\n  of your npm executable should you have\n  [any issues](https://github.com/hughsk/atom-npm-install/issues/2).\n\n## Changelog\n\n### 3.0.0\n\n* Packages must now be selected to be installed. This gives\n  you control over which packages are being installed instead\n  of trying to work that out for you, making it simpler to\n  support [scoped packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scope) :sparkles:.\n* The installation pane is now attached to the right\n  instead of the bottom of the screen.\n* ES6 support! No more parsing errors, also `import`\n  statements can be installed like you would requires too.\n* CoffeeScript is no longer supported. If you'd like that back, I'd recommend\nsticking with the previous version or submitting a pull request to\n[atom-selected-requires](https://github.com/hughsk/atom-selected-requires).\n\n### 2.0.0\n\nAs of version `2.0.0` keybindings are not included by default. If you miss\nthese shortcuts, simply add the following to your keymap file:\n\n``` coffeescript\n'.workspace':\n  'ctrl-alt-i': 'npm-install:save'\n  'ctrl-alt-d': 'npm-install:save-dev'\n```\n\n## License ##\n\nMIT.
