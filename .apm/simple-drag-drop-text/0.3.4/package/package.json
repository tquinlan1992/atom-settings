This mimics the standard behavior of many other editors.  Dragging and dropping with the modifier key held will copy the text instead of moving it. You may change the modifier key in the Settings; options are `CTRL`, `ALT`, and `META` (super/Windows/command).\n\n---\n\n![Image inserted by Atom editor package auto-host-markdown-image](http://i.imgur.com/A7IeEag.gif)\n\n---\n\n### Installation\n\nEnter `apm install simple-drag-drop-text` or use the settings page.\n\n---\n\n### Usage\n\nThere is no Atom command.  \n\nDrag/drop is triggered by clicking and dragging a text selection from one place to another. If the modifier key is held when the mouse is released then the text will be copied instead of moved. The default modifier key is `CTRL` but you may change this in the Settings to either `ALT` or `META` (super/Windows/command).\n\n### Alternative Package\n\nThere is a sister package to this one, `drag-drop-text`. It is more complex but it has a small learning curve and does not follow the standard behavior of other editors.\n\n---\n\n### License\n\nCopyright Mark Hahn using the MIT license.
