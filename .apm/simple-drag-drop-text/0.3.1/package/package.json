This mimics the standard behavior of many other editors.  Dragging and dropping with the `ALT` key held will copy the text instead of moving it.\n\n---\n\n![Image inserted by Atom editor package auto-host-markdown-image](http://i.imgur.com/A7IeEag.gif)\n\n---\n\n### Installation\n\nEnter `atom install simple-drag-drop-text` or use the settings page.\n\n---\n\n### Usage\n\nThere is no Atom command.  \n\nDrag/drop is triggered by clicking and dragging a text selection from one palce to another. Dragging with no modifer key will move the text to the position the mouse is released.  If the `ALT` key is down when the mouse is released then the text will be copied instead of moved.  The `ALT` key does not have to pressed before this time.\n\n### Alternative Package \n\nThere is a sister package to this one, `drag-drop-text`.  It offers more features but it has a small learning curve and does not follow the standard behavior of other editors.  This is for true mouse-loving geeks (like me).\n\nDrag-drop-text package features ...\n\n- No need for any modifier key like `ALT` for any operation.  Everything is done with the left mouse button.\n- You can do the standard cut (`ctrl-x`), copy (`ctrl-c`), and paste (`ctrl-v`) operations using only the mouse.\n- Text that has been dragged is left in the clipboard.  So you can drag and then paste the same text again.\n\n---\n\n### License\n\nCopyright Mark Hahn using the MIT license\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mark-hahn/simple-drag-drop-text/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/mark-hahn/simple-drag-drop-text#readme","_id":"simple-drag-drop-text@0.3.1","_shasum":"af21064c2cc13e784e0791a951aef2a03af8bb3e","_resolved":"file:../d-116727-68916-1mpvlst/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116727-68916-1mpvlst/package.tgz"}
